#Workflow Details:
This workflow uses mothur package to perform bacterial classification. 
Classification is done on chunked data and taxonomy details are summarized in the end. 

#How to run:
cd <your_working directory>
yap --check workflow_configuration.cfg

The "yap --check"  command checks to see

* If all paths specified are valid
* If YAP finds the appropriate input files
* Checks for syntax errors
* Lists commands to be executed.
* Gives section-wise error/warning report.

#The next step is to run the YAP job:

mpirun -n <number_of_cores> yap workflow_configuration.cfg

If you have a SGE environment. Pass the number of slots variable $NSLOTS.
